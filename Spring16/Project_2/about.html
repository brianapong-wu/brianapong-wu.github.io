                	<h2>Our History</h2>
                    <p>Arthur J. Simms served as a bombardier and navigator in the European theater during World War II. After the war, he became involved in the restaurant business, an area in which he had some familiarity. He opened his first restaurant in 1952 with partner Bob Ehrman, a coffee shop called Ben Frank's. Two more Ben Frank's would open in the Los Angeles area, and Simms also ran another coffee shop chain called the Wooden Shoes. Simms's son Thomas had no intention of following his father into the restaurant business. However, he graduated during poor economic conditions, and, unable to find an engineering job, he opted to join his father. Among their ventures was a sidewalk café called the French Quarter, which they opened in West Hollywood in 1974. Two years later, they acquired an upscale coffee shop, The Kettle, located in Manhattan Beach. Unfortunately for the father-son enterprise, the prosperous days for coffee shops were beginning to fade, primarily because of higher rents that resulted in the need for a higher level of sales.</p>
						
					<p>Arthur and his son Thomas recognized that there was an opening in the market for a restaurant that was part coffee shop and part dinner house, combining the atmosphere of the latter with the value of the former, a niche that would one day be classified as casual dining. They turned to their French Quarter restaurant as a starting point for creating an eatery that essentially Americanized the European café. For a name they chose Mimi's Café. According to company lore, Mimi was a French woman Arthur Simms met during World War II. Purportedly, he flew dangerous spy missions over occupied France, but near the end of the war he was on the ground with the troops liberating a small French town. Here Simms met Mimi, with whom he had a one-night love affair. Although they would never see each other again, he would never forget her, and naming the new restaurant after her was a tribute to their short-lived romance. In 1996, Simms explained that while he was serving as a bombardier and navigator, hardly a spy, he was in France in 1944 because his plane had delivered a general there. At a hotel party in a newly liberated French town, he did have an affair with a woman named Mimi, but it was far from an all-consuming romance. As for paying homage to Mimi by naming the new restaurant after her, Simms recalled telling his son, "'What're we gonna call it, Mimi's or Gigi's?' Flipped a coin and it was Mimi's."</p>
