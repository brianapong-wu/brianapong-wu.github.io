		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        
<p>The following Privacy Policy statement explains what information we collect from you, how we use that information and what choices you have with respect to that information. This Privacy Policy only applies to information we collect online at MimisCafe.com</p>

<p><span class="legaltitles">WHAT INFORMATION DO WE GATHER ABOUT OUR ONLINE VISITORS, AND HOW DO WE USE THAT INFORMATION?</span><br />
We gather information through two means - navigational information gathered when you visit this Web site and information that you provide to us. Generally, the information we collect online helps us respond to your requests, deliver requested services to or for you, and personalize and continually improve your experience at MimisCafe.com.</p>

<p><span class="legaltitles">NAVIGATIONAL INFORMATION</span><br />
When visiting this Web site, MimisCafe.com gathers navigational information about where visitors go on this Web site. This information allows us to see which areas of this Web site are most visited and thus, improve the quality of our visitors' experience by recognizing and delivering more of the features, services and products our visitors prefer. Additional non-personally identifiable information (for example, domain type, browser version, service provider, IP address) may be collected, which provides additional information regarding the use of this Web site, such as how many times a page on this Web site is visited. MimisCafe.com uses this information on an aggregate basis to evaluate the effectiveness of this Web site, to analyze trends and to administer this Web site.</p>

<p><span class="legaltitles">INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US AND HOW WE USE IT</span><br />
If you complete a "Contact Us" form on this Web site, we may collect your name, email address, phone number, the location where you visited us and any information that you provide in the text of your message. Information provided in the "User Comments" feature is only used to respond to your inquiries.</p>

<p>If you purchase a gift card on this Web site, we will ask you to provide your name, credit card information, billing address, email address, any message that you would like to include with your gift card, as well as the recipient's name and the address to which you would like the gift card to be shipped. This information is only used to process your gift card purchase.</p>

<p>Depending upon which location guide feature you use on this Web site, we may ask you to provide your address and/or your destination address. This information is used to provide you with the location information you request. MimisCafe.com reserves the right to use this information on an aggregate basis to analyze trends and help us determine what store information is most frequently accessed by our visitors.</p>

<p>If you indicate while visiting this Web site that you would like to join Mimi'sâ„¢ E-Club, MimisCafe.com will collect your name, zip code and email address and will use the email address that you provide to send Mimi's Cafe marketing materials to you. If you previously signed up to receive Mimi's Cafe marketing materials through the Mimi's E-Club but would now like to be removed from the MimisCafe.com email marketing list, you can either use the "unsubscribe" feature on our emails or send your request to unsubscribe@MimisCafe.com. Please be aware, even if you do not "opt-in" to, or subsequently ask to be removed from, the MimisCafe.com email marketing list, you may still receive email confirmations for any gift card purchases made on this Web site.</p>

<p>MimisCafe.com does not sell, rent or trade the information that you provide to us at this Web site, but may share the information you provide at this website with its sister company, Le Duff America, Inc., and other affiliates in the future. We will also use third parties to help us provide services to you, such as fulfilling online gift card orders, processing payments, monitoring activity on this Web site, conducting surveys, providing online driving directions, and administering emails or contests that may occasionally be offered at this Web site. If personally identifiable information (i.e., name, address, email address, telephone number) is provided by us or by you directly to any of these third parties, we will require that such information be maintained by them in confidence.</p>

<p>As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any preexisting Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Mimi's Cafe, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</p>

<p>You should also be aware that we may disclose specific information about you if necessary to do so by law or based on our good faith belief that it is necessary to conform or comply with the law or is necessary to protect this Web site, the users of this Web site, or the public.</p>

<p><span class="legaltitles">USE OF COOKIES</span><br />
MimisCafe.com occasionally uses a browser feature known as a cookie, which assigns a unique identification to your computer. Cookies are typically stored on your computer's hard drive and on our Web site are used to assist with functionality so that we can be more responsive to your needs, while delivering a better experience to you. Please also be aware that some of the third party service providers that we use on this Web site to help us provide services to you (for example, the store locator feature) may use cookies.</p>

<p><span class="legaltitles">CHANGES IN POLICY</span><br />
As we continue to offer you new and different types of content and services, MimisCafe.com may modify our information collection and use practices. Should there be a material change to our information practices, it will be applied only to information collected on a going-forward basis, and we will update this Privacy Policy statement. If you are concerned about how your personal information is used, please visit this Web site for this and other important announcements from MimisCafe.com.</p>

<p><span class="legaltitles">SECURITY</span><br />
We accept gift card orders only from Web browsers that permit communication to us through Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. Please be aware, however, that any information sent to us by any means other than one of the built-in forms on this Web site (such as an email message generated manually by you) will not be sent through an encrypted or secured connection.</p>

<p>As an additional security measure, it is our policy to never send credit card information via email. In addition, MimisCafe.com limits the number of employees that have access to the databases that contain personal information, and all MimisCafe.com employees are advised of the importance of confidentiality.</p>

<p><span class="legaltitles">INTERACTION WITH CHILDREN</span><br />
To ensure compliance with federal law, MimisCafe.com does not knowingly collect or maintain information provided by children under the age of 13.</p>

<p><span class="legaltitles">UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</span><br />
We prefer to keep your personal information accurate and up-to-date. To do this, we provide you with the opportunity to update or modify your membership information for Mimi's E-Club.</p>
